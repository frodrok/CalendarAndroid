# Android client for the calendar project

Behind the scenes most actions will be handled by consuming and producing JSON
to communicate with the RESTapi that handles the backend. This app will be a 
front with a login screen and a calendar. The biggest assignment is serializing
and deserializing JSON and mapping it from and to data that a calendar could handle.
